This project is designed to communicate with an API and display the data in a visually appealing way. The goal is to build a page that displays multiple user cards at the same time, similar to what can be found on the Random User Generator website. The data for the cards will be sourced from the Random User Generator API.(https://randomuser.me/)


## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
  python main.py
```
or
```bash
  python3 main.py
```
    
## Usage

* Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/.
* The page will display a series of user cards, sourced from the Random User Generator API.
* Click the "New" button below each card to generate a new user and update the information displayed.
* Use the gender filter buttons at the top of the page to filter the displayed users by gender.
* Click the delete button in the top right corner of each card to remove that user's card from the display.
